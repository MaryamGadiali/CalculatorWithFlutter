# CalculatorWithFlutter
Calculator made with Flutter

As the title says, I programmed a calculator using Flutter. Apologies for the horrible colour scheme :D, I was *experimenting*. 

Followed the Youtube tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVG5DkPF5x8 but added my own techniques, such as using switch-case statements instead of ifs etc.

If you are unfamiliar with Flutter, which uses Dart programming language, you can find the main programmed code, in the 'lib' folder> 'main'.dart .
